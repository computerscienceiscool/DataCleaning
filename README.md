# DataCleaning: Code Cleaning Exercise

In the world of data analytics, cleaning and preprocessing raw data is a crucial step before any meaningful analysis can take place. One common challenge in this process is dealing with missing values, often represented as `NaN`s. These missing values can adversely affect the accuracy and reliability of any analysis or modeling efforts.

To address this issue, I explored techniques for handling missing values and imputing appropriate values in Python using **Matplotlib** and **Pandas** libraries. Matplotlib is a popular data visualization library, while Pandas provides efficient data manipulation tools.

In this code cleaning exercise, we will focus on three key steps: 
1. Identifying missing values 
2. Handling missing values by either removing or imputing them
3. Validating the effectiveness of the approach. 

By the end of this exercise, I cleaned and prepared dataset ready for further analysis or modeling. This also includes a little bit of **PCA**!
